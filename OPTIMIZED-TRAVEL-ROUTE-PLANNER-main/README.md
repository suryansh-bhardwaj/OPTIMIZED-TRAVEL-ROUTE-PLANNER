# OPTIMIZED-TRAVEL-ROUTE-PLANNER

This project is designed to help travelers plan optimal travel routes between different locations using graph data structures. It represents locations as nodes and paths (roads or transportation routes) as edges. The application calculates the shortest path between two locations, considering factors such as distance, travel time, and cost.

## Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with graph data structures and algorithms.
- Understanding of different types of graphs (directed, undirected, and weighted).
- How to represent and traverse graphs using adjacency lists or matrices.
- Implementation of graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s, DFS (Depth-First Search), and BFS (Breadth-First Search) for finding the shortest paths.
- Skills in data handling, input/output operations, and user interface design.

## What it takes to execute this project

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent locations as nodes and edges as travel routes. Assign weights to edges based on distance, travel time, or cost.
2. **Graph Traversal**: Implement depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find possible routes.
3. **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Implement algorithms like Dijkstra’s for finding optimal routes based on factors like distance, time, or cost.
4. **Efficient Path-finding**: Utilize data structures like priority queues or heaps to optimize path-finding efficiency.
5. **Constraints Handling**: Handle constraints such as budget, travel mode, or stopover preferences.
6. **External API Integration**: Integrate with external APIs for real-time updates, location data, or travel information.


## Real-World Applications

- **Navigation Systems**: GPS devices and mapping systems can implement this application to help travelers find the best routes.
- **Logistics & Supply Chain**: Companies can optimize delivery routes for trucks to reduce costs and improve delivery times.
- **Travel Agencies**: This application can assist travel agencies in planning efficient routes for clients, taking into account various constraints like budget and travel preferences.

## Technologies Used

- Graph Data Structures
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (for shortest path calculation)
- DFS and BFS (for route exploration)
- APIs for real-time data

## How to Use

1. Input the source and destination locations.
2. Specify your preferences such as budget, mode of travel, or stopovers.
3. The system will calculate and display the optimal route based on your criteria.
